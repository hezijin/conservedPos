Description: The goal of conservedPos package is to find important conserved 
  sites for small target region by conducting a site-specific analysis 
  for a set of aligned DNA sequences. 
  The package will provide function to count nucleotides occurrances 
  in each position independently and calculates the frequency of the 
  nucleotides in order to quantify the conservity of each position.
